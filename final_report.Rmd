## **Introduction**
Music is widely enjoyed around the world but rarely does one question what metrics define <i>good music</i>. In such an assesment, one needs to quantify qualities of music. To determine what metrics need to be used an analysis of popularity compared to aspects of music, including but not limited to, energy, liveliness, danceability, et cetera, needs to be considered. The data sets used in this analysis are the "Data from 1921-2021 of songs on Spotify" and "2019 Top 50 Songs on Spotify" which have been taken from Kaggle. "Data from 1921-2021 of songs on Spotify" contains over 175,000 songs spanning from 1912 until 2020. "2019 Top 50 Songs on Spotify" shows the top 50 songs of 2019 from all over the globe. Using these datasets and methods in R, we evaluated top artists from the year based on trends in music related metrics and popularity over time.

## **Research Questions**
To achieve our goal, we have developed five general areas of exploration with the following five research questions: 

- What are the most frequent genres of the top artists?
- Do the most popular artists align well with the rest of their genre?
- How have energy, liveliness, danceability, duration, speechiness, and tempo changed throughout the years?
- Did the information about the most popular artist during a given year follow the change of energy, liveliness, danceability, duration, speechiness, and tempo?
- What are the most popular genres and artists?
- Are there any audio features that most top songs have in common?

## **Overview of the Dataset**
Two datasets were used in this analysis: "Data from 1921-2021 of songs on Spotify", "2019 Top 50 Songs on Spotify". These datasets were gathered from Kaggle but originally scraped from the Spotify public API or organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com. "Data from 1921-2021 of songs on Spotify" contains over 175,000 songs spanning from 1912 until 2020. This data compares songs by their genre, year of release, artist, and so forth. "2019 Top 50 Songs on Spotify" shows the top 50 songs of 2019 from all over the globe. Both datasets contain a combination of categorical and numerical data that can be used for analysis.

#### **Obtaining the dataset**
We obtained both sets of data from Kaggle.  
- The first dataset we used was *Data from 1921-2021 of songs on Spotify* which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).   
- The second dataset we used was *2019 Top 50 Songs on Spotify* which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top50spotify2019).   
  
#### **What is in the dataset**
*Data from 1921-2021 of songs on Spotify*  
This dataset contains over 175,000 songs spanning from 1912 until 2020. This data was collected from the spotifyAPI. This data compares songs by their genre, year of release, artist, and so forth.  
  
*2019 Top 50 Songs on Spotify*   
This dataset shows the top 50 songs of 2019 from all over the globe. The data was originally gathered from http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com. The dataset contains 13 different variables.

## **Exploratory Analysis**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(reshape)
library(Hmisc)
library(ggpubr)
```

#### **- What are the most frequent genres of the top artists?**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results=FALSE, fig.align='default', fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
genres <- read.csv("./1921_2020_spotify/data_by_genres.csv")
artists <- read.csv("./1921_2020_spotify/data_w_genres.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results=FALSE, fig.align='default', fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
topArtists <- arrange(artists, -popularity) %>%
  filter(genres != "[]") %>%
  head(100)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='default', fig.show="hold"}
topArtists$genres <- substr(topArtists$genres, 3, nchar(topArtists$genres)-2)
topArtistsList <- topArtists %>%
  separate(col=genres, sep="\', \'", into=c("g1", "g2", "g3", "g4", "g5", "g6"))

genreTable <- table(topArtistsList$g1)
genreCount <- as.data.frame(genreTable)
genreCount <- filter(genreCount, Freq > 2)

ggplot(genreCount,aes(x=reorder(Var1, -Freq), y=Freq)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity', fill="blue") +
  xlab("Artists' Genre") + 
  ylab("Number of occurances in top 100 Artists")
```
 
We can see from the plot the top 7 genres of artists currently in the top 100. The results surprised me a little bit at first until I remember that this data is world-wide so it would make sense that the most popular in the use, like dance pop and pop, aren't necessarily the top in the whole world.

#### **- Do the most popular artists align well with the rest of their genre?**

Plot the top artists of the latin and pop genres to compare their features with their genre's average.
```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='default', fig.show="hold"}

cols <- c("artists", "acousticness", "danceability", "energy", "instrumentalness", "liveness", "speechiness", "valence")

latinArtists <- topArtistsList %>%
  filter(g1 == "latin") %>%
  head(3) %>%
  select(cols)

popArtists <- topArtistsList %>%
  filter(g1 == "pop") %>%
  head(3) %>%
  select(cols)

genresTop <- genres %>%
  dplyr::rename(artists = genres) %>%
  select(cols) %>%
  filter(artists == "latin" | artists == "pop")

featureCols <- c("acousticness",	"danceability",	"energy",	"instrumentalness",	"liveness", "speechiness", "valence")

latinBoth <- rbind(genresTop %>% filter(artists == "latin"), latinArtists)
latinMelted <- melt(latinBoth, id.vars="artists", measure.vars=featureCols, variable_name = "feature")
latinPlot <- ggplot(latinMelted, aes(feature, value, fill=artists)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = 'dodge')+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjus=1)) 

popBoth <- rbind(genresTop %>% filter(artists == "pop"), popArtists)
popMelted <- melt(popBoth, id.vars="artists", measure.vars=featureCols, variable_name = "feature")
popPlot <- ggplot(popMelted, aes(feature, value, fill=artists)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = 'dodge')+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjus=1)) 

ggarrange(latinPlot, popPlot,
          labels = c("A", "B"),
          ncol = 1, nrow = 2)
```
  
Plot A represents the latin genre and plot B represents the pop genre. For these plots I used the 3 most popular artists from each genre. I used latin because it is the most frequent genre and pop because it had the artists most likely to be known by our class. We can see in the latin section that danceability, speechiness, and valence for the 3 artist is much higher than the average. On the other hand they had lower acousticness than the average in latin.  
For the pop genre we saw a few different trends. The top 3 artists had a lower danceability, energy, liveness, and valence than average in pop. However, they all had a higher acousticness than the average. This might show a new trend in pop for more slow songs that focus more on the vocals than the music behind them.

ADD YOUR ANALYSIS HERE
#### **- Are there any variables that are highly correlated?**
```{r}
top50 <- read.csv("C://Users//caitl//Documents//DS 202//Final Project//top50.csv")
str(top50)

##finding correlations between numerical variables
topnum <- top50 %>% select(-Track.Name, -Artist.Name, -Genre) 
topnum %>% cor()
```

Energy and Loudness..db.. have a moderately strong correlation of 0.671, which means that they express a lot of similar information. Also, Speechiness. and Beats.Per.Minute have a moderately strong correlation of 0.557. 

#### **- Are there any audio features that most top songs have in common?**
```{r}
a <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Beats.Per.Minute))+geom_boxplot()  
b <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Energy))+geom_boxplot()
c <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Danceability))+geom_boxplot()
d <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Loudness..dB..))+geom_boxplot()
e <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Liveness))+geom_boxplot()
f <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Valence.))+geom_boxplot()
g <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Length.))+geom_boxplot()
h <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Acousticness..))+geom_boxplot()
i <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Speechiness.))+geom_boxplot()
j <- ggplot(topnum, aes(x=Popularity))+geom_boxplot()
ggarrange(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j, ncol=3, nrow=4)
```

Beats.Per.Minute has a mean of 120.1 beats per minute and had a very skewed right distribution. In general, the Top 50 songs had relatively high tempos.

Energy has a mean of 64.06 and is slightly skewed to the left. Overall, the Top 50 songs had a tendency to be moderately to high energy songs. 

Danceability has a mean of 71.38 and is very skewed to the left. Overall, the Top 50 songs were very easy to dance to according to the danceability rating. 

Loudness..dB.. has a mean of -5.66 is relatively symmetric. The Top 50 songs tended to be relatively loud songs as the mean is close to 0. 

Liveness has a mean of 14.66 and is very skewed to the right. This means that the Top 50 tracks were generally not very likely to be live tracks recorded.

Valence. has a mean of 54.6, a range from 10 to 95, and is bimodal but pretty symmetric. Valence reflects the overall positive mood of a song. Since the range of valence is so large and given the distribution, we see that the Top 50 songs included both positive and negative moods. Since the mean was 54.6 and the distribution was bimodal, we could say that the Top 50 songs equally represent positive and negative moods.

Length. has a mean of 201 seconds and is symmetric.

Acousticness.. has a mean of 22.16 and is skewed to the right. Generally, the Top 50 songs tended to not be very acoustic.

Speechiness. has a mean of 12.48 and is skewed to the right. Since the mean of speechiness is so low, the Top 50 songs did not commonly include many spoken words.

Popularity has a mean of 87.5 and is skewed to the left. Since the high value for popularity is 100, it makes sense that the Top 50 songs of the year had high popularity ratings.

Common Features:
Medium to high energy,
high danceability,
relatively loud,
not likely to be live,
equal range of valence,
around 2-4 minutes long,
not very acoustic,
very little spoken words,
overall, pretty high popularity ratings.

#### **- Are ranking or beats per minute affected by popularity?**
```{r}
ggplot(data=top50, aes(x=X, y=Beats.Per.Minute, color=Popularity))+geom_point()+xlab("Chart Ranking")+ylab("Beats Per Minute")+ggtitle("Ranking vs. Beats Per Minute by Popularity")
```

No major correlation between popularity and ranking or between beats per minute and popularity.
The #1 song actually has one of the lowest popularity ratings
